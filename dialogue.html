User 1: Can you accomplish this task on Platform A? No. You cannot.
User 2: I cannot comprehend how users of Platform B constantly harass me, a Platform A user, when I am trying to
make casual conversation with them.
User 1: There is no logical reason to use Platform A.
User 2: Personally, I find Platform A easier to use.
User 1: Install Addon A to replicate the feel of Platform A with the underlying core of Platform B.
User 2: The advantageous quality of the tasks I accomplish in my life on Platform A make me not want to switch.
User 1: Consider using a similarly-specificationed device with Addon A.
User 2: Additionally, Platform A provides better aesthetics to me.
User 2: Unfortunately, I will not do that. We both have our own preferences, but I do not tell everyone to
cease using the platform of their choice.
User 1: That is only because you want to be in the majority. Platform B is easier to use thanks to the 
openness of the platform, and the workload you desire is actually accomplished better.
User 2: I am not well-versed in the back-end of the platforms, but Platform A is a better experience to me.
Switching to Platform B when I have only used Platform A makes no sense to me.
User 1: Have you considered using Addon A?
User 2: Why would I use Addon A if I do not have any devices on Platform B?
User 1: You get the functionality of Platform B with the looks of Platform A.
User 2: I will not change my platform and ruin my workload because a stranger told me to.
User 1: It's cheaper.
User 2: I am confused as to the gravity of the situation.
User 3: Use the platform you prefer.
User 2: Exactly.
User 2: User 1 is trying to convince everyone else to use Platform B.
User 1: I am saying that most users of Platform A care that is is Platform A.
User 1: Your workload would be much better on Platform B.
User 1: Therefore, you either are ignorant on the situation or you are too stubborn to change.
User 1: How can you spend so much currency without doing research?
User 2: I would not refer to myself as a fan simply for the name, I prefer Platform A in terms of ease of use.
Your point about my workload being better is wrong, you are trying to argue something invalid when you disagree
with another person's preference. I implore you to return when you have actual proof of your statement.
User 1: I would only have to do 10 minutes of research to prove my point.
User 1: The camera on my Platform B device is superior to yours.
User 2: I have made 0 mistakes thus far.
User 1: Addon A makes transitioning between platforms easy.
User 2: My only mistake has been conversating with you.
User 1: Neither of your points are valid.
User 2: They are, please stop harassing me.
User 4: User 1, please direct your complaints to people better suited to listen to you.
User 1: I have, and I will continue to do so over the summer season.
User 4: Sorry, but I will not keep myself on notice for that. You should consider talking to yourself so that
you can discern a response easier.
User 2: "Hello Platform A creator, I am writing to tell you that I dislike your platform and Platform B is
superior in the workload User 2 requires, but I can not demonstrate this currently as my sexual organ is lodged
inside of a wall socket to provide the best lighting for my action as part of this workload so I can demonstrate
the sole item of validity I have." -  User 1
User 4: That is a funny statement.
User 1: That is incorrect, perform research first.
User 2: Why should I when I have nothing to fix?
User 1: You have spent currency on something that I do not recommend. You should care about that.
User 2: I have enough currency that I get to decide that.
User 1: That is not a reason for you to do so.
User 2: It is to me. I'd rather use more currency on something I'm familiar with.
User 1: You are ignoring the options Platform B presents to you.
User 2: Why are you promoting a simulacrum to Platform A if you hate Platform A?
User 1: I see no reason not to.
User 4: People have differing opinions on platforms.
User 2: You are making it seem like Addon A is necessary to accomplish all Platform A can do on Platform B.
User 1: Incorrect. It runs superior without Addon A, but Addon A was designed for people who prefer the
feel of Platform A.
User 2: You are still a rude person for coercing others to use the platform you prefer.
User 4: None of these platforms should exist so this conversation would never happen and I would not be
degrading my intellectual capacity by listening to User 1.
User 2: We don't care, User 1. I am trying to explain why I prefer Platform A, please refrain from attempting
to force me into your preferences. People agree and disagree, but at the end of the day it is simply one
platform versus the other. This conversation should not have to occupy other people's time.
User 5: This is an interesting conversation. I like spectating it.
User 1: Simply a platform versus platform discussion? Most of us are spending additional currency on an
inferior platform. I believe that is something that we should be discussing.
User 5: You are trying to force your opinion upon others as if it was fact, User 1. Not everyone will
agree with you, but that does not make your opinion incorrect. Simply refrain from arguing it because
everyone is allowed their own belief.
User 1: My opinion is a fact, but I will listen to you.
User 5: It is not, it is an opinion.
User 1: Platform B accomplishes all Platform A can, including in the aesthetics department with Addon A.
User 1: Therefore, my statement is fact.
User 2: Addon A does not seem very accurate to Platform A.
User 1: I do not enjoy that, hence I use Addon B instead.
User 2: I also do not like Addon B's look, which is why I use Platform A. That is my opinion, not a fact.
User 1: Install Addon A instead. From my experience, it is exactly the same as Platform A.
User 2: I do not need to, as I have a Platform A device. What are you trying to make me do, User 1?
User 1: You are giving up switching to Platform B because of one addon?
User 2: That is true, as Platform B does not meet my standards for a platform. I've spent enough currency,
as you said, so I should keep this device.
User 1: Addon A offers the same aesthetics, however.
User 2: Please stop.
User 6: User 1, you are rambling incoherently at this point. Consider quitting.
User 7: User 1, let people have their own prefernces.
User 1: But, Addon A off-
User 7: Stop. People do not want Platform B.
User 8: I prefer Platform A.
User 7: Then, the people who do not want Platform B should not use it.
User 7: I prefer Platform B, but I don't tell everyone that their choice is incorrect.
User 1: What device do you have, User 7?
User 7: Device A.
User 1: I have Device C, which is two revisions above yours.
User 7: That does not matter to me. It is too expensive for what I need, and my Device A still works as it
did when I first received it.
User 1: This unrelated task on my Platform C device is causing me to be frustrated as to the amount of time it
takes.
User 2: As you can see, this screenshot of Platform B is aesthetically unpleasing. I am replicating your
actions, User 1, by attempting to coerce other people to use this.
User 1: I will attempt to recreate this.
User 2: I do not want you to do that, I am simply demonstrating your foolishness.
User 1: I will do it anyway.
User 2: Please do not show us.
User 8: Please do show us.
User 1: I can provide it in Platform B's format.
User 7: Platform A does not support Platform B's format
User 1: I am aware of that.
User 7: What is the point exactly?
User 1: My unrelated task on Platform C is continuing.
User 2: Take this information elsewhere.
User 1: OK.
User 6: User 1 is attempting to prove his intellectual superiority.
User 7: User 6, please watch your tone. [SARCASTIC]
User 6: I apologize, User 7.
