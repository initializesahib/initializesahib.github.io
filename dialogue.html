User 1: Can you accomplish this task on Platform A? No. You cannot.<br>
User 2: I cannot comprehend how users of Platform B constantly harass me, a Platform A user, when I am trying to make casual conversation with them.<br>
User 1: There is no logical reason to use Platform A.<br>
User 2: Personally, I find Platform A easier to use.<br>
User 1: Install Addon A to replicate the feel of Platform A with the underlying core of Platform B.<br>
User 2: The advantageous quality of the tasks I accomplish in my life on Platform A make me not want to switch.<br>
User 1: Consider using a similarly-specificationed device with Addon A.<br>
User 2: Additionally, Platform A provides better aesthetics to me.<br>
User 2: Unfortunately, I will not do that. We both have our own preferences, but I do not tell everyone to cease using the platform of their choice.<br>
User 1: That is only because you want to be in the majority. Platform B is easier to use thanks to the openness of the platform, and the workload you desire is actually accomplished better.<br>
User 2: I am not well-versed in the back-end of the platforms, but Platform A is a better experience to me. Switching to Platform B when I have only used Platform A makes no sense to me.<br>
User 1: Have you considered using Addon A?<br>
User 2: Why would I use Addon A if I do not have any devices on Platform B?<br>
User 1: You get the functionality of Platform B with the looks of Platform A.<br>
User 2: I will not change my platform and ruin my workload because a stranger told me to.<br>
User 1: It's cheaper.<br>
User 2: I am confused as to the gravity of the situation.<br>
User 3: Use the platform you prefer.<br>
User 2: Exactly.<br>
User 2: User 1 is trying to convince everyone else to use Platform B.<br>
User 1: I am saying that most users of Platform A care that is is Platform A.<br>
User 1: Your workload would be much better on Platform B.<br>
User 1: Therefore, you either are ignorant on the situation or you are too stubborn to change.<br>
User 1: How can you spend so much currency without doing research?<br>
User 2: I would not refer to myself as a fan simply for the name, I prefer Platform A in terms of ease of use. Your point about my workload being better is wrong, you are trying to argue something invalid when you disagree with another person's preference. I implore you to return when you have actual proof of your statement.<br>
User 1: I would only have to do 10 minutes of research to prove my point.<br>
User 1: The camera on my Platform B device is superior to yours.<br>
User 2: I have made 0 mistakes thus far.<br>
User 1: Addon A makes transitioning between platforms easy.<br>
User 2: My only mistake has been conversating with you.<br>
User 1: Neither of your points are valid.<br>
User 2: They are, please stop harassing me.<br>
User 4: User 1, please direct your complaints to people better suited to listen to you.<br>
User 1: I have, and I will continue to do so over the summer season.<br>
User 4: Sorry, but I will not keep myself on notice for that. You should consider talking to yourself so that you can discern a response easier.<br>
User 2: "Hello Platform A creator, I am writing to tell you that I dislike your platform and Platform B is superior in the workload User 2 requires, but I can not demonstrate this currently as my sexual organ is lodged inside of a wall socket to provide the best lighting for my action as part of this workload so I can demonstrate the sole item of validity I have." -  User 1<br>
User 4: That is a funny statement.<br>
User 1: That is incorrect, perform research first.<br>
User 2: Why should I when I have nothing to fix?<br>
User 1: You have spent currency on something that I do not recommend. You should care about that.<br>
User 2: I have enough currency that I get to decide that.<br>
User 1: That is not a reason for you to do so.<br>
User 2: It is to me. I'd rather use more currency on something I'm familiar with.<br>
User 1: You are ignoring the options Platform B presents to you.<br>
User 2: Why are you promoting a simulacrum to Platform A if you hate Platform A?<br>
User 1: I see no reason not to.<br>
User 4: People have differing opinions on platforms.<br>
User 2: You are making it seem like Addon A is necessary to accomplish all Platform A can do on Platform B.<br>
User 1: Incorrect. It runs superior without Addon A, but Addon A was designed for people who prefer the feel of Platform A.<br>
User 2: You are still a rude person for coercing others to use the platform you prefer.<br>
User 4: None of these platforms should exist so this conversation would never happen and I would not be degrading my intellectual capacity by listening to User 1.<br>
User 2: We don't care, User 1. I am trying to explain why I prefer Platform A, please refrain from attempting<br>
to force me into your preferences. People agree and disagree, but at the end of the day it is simply one<br>
platform versus the other. This conversation should not have to occupy other people's time.<br>
User 5: This is an interesting conversation. I like spectating it.<br>
User 1: Simply a platform versus platform discussion? Most of us are spending additional currency on an<br>
inferior platform. I believe that is something that we should be discussing.<br>
User 5: You are trying to force your opinion upon others as if it was fact, User 1. Not everyone will<br>
agree with you, but that does not make your opinion incorrect. Simply refrain from arguing it because<br>
everyone is allowed their own belief.<br>
User 1: My opinion is a fact, but I will listen to you.<br>
User 5: It is not, it is an opinion.<br>
User 1: Platform B accomplishes all Platform A can, including in the aesthetics department with Addon A.<br>
User 1: Therefore, my statement is fact.<br>
User 2: Addon A does not seem very accurate to Platform A.<br>
User 1: I do not enjoy that, hence I use Addon B instead.<br>
User 2: I also do not like Addon B's look, which is why I use Platform A. That is my opinion, not a fact.<br>
User 1: Install Addon A instead. From my experience, it is exactly the same as Platform A.<br>
User 2: I do not need to, as I have a Platform A device. What are you trying to make me do, User 1?<br>
User 1: You are giving up switching to Platform B because of one addon?<br>
User 2: That is true, as Platform B does not meet my standards for a platform. I've spent enough currency,<br>
as you said, so I should keep this device.<br>
User 1: Addon A offers the same aesthetics, however.<br>
User 2: Please stop.<br>
User 6: User 1, you are rambling incoherently at this point. Consider quitting.<br>
User 7: User 1, let people have their own prefernces.<br>
User 1: But, Addon A off-<br>
User 7: Stop. People do not want Platform B.<br>
User 8: I prefer Platform A.<br>
User 7: Then, the people who do not want Platform B should not use it.<br>
User 7: I prefer Platform B, but I don't tell everyone that their choice is incorrect.<br>
User 1: What device do you have, User 7?<br>
User 7: Device A.<br>
User 1: I have Device C, which is two revisions above yours.<br>
User 7: That does not matter to me. It is too expensive for what I need, and my Device A still works as it<br>
did when I first received it.<br>
User 1: This unrelated task on my Platform C device is causing me to be frustrated as to the amount of time it
takes.<br>
User 2: As you can see, this screenshot of Platform B is aesthetically unpleasing. I am replicating your<br>
actions, User 1, by attempting to coerce other people to use this.<br>
User 1: I will attempt to recreate this.<br>
User 2: I do not want you to do that, I am simply demonstrating your foolishness.<br>
User 1: I will do it anyway.<br>
User 2: Please do not show us.<br>
User 8: Please do show us.<br>
User 1: I can provide it in Platform B's format.<br>
User 7: Platform A does not support Platform B's format<br>
User 1: I am aware of that.<br>
User 7: What is the point exactly?<br>
User 1: My unrelated task on Platform C is continuing.<br>
User 2: Take this information elsewhere.<br>
User 1: OK.<br>
User 6: User 1 is attempting to prove his intellectual superiority.<br>
User 7: User 6, please watch your tone. [SARCASTIC]<br>
User 6: I apologize, User 7.<br>
